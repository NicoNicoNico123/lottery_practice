This repository provides a hands-on practice for utilizing TensorFlow's predictive modeling capabilities to analyze historical lottery data and attempt to forecast future lottery outcomes. This project serves as a learning tool for individuals interested in exploring the applications of TensorFlow and building their machine learning skills.

While the ability to accurately predict lottery results is inherently challenging due to the probabilistic nature of lottery draws, this project aims to provide a practical introduction to TensorFlow's functionalities and demonstrate its potential for predictive modeling tasks.

## Overview

The primary focus of this project is to apply TensorFlow, a powerful open-source software library for machine learning, in predicting the outcomes of lottery draws. We will explore various aspects of TensorFlow, including data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.
